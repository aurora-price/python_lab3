#part_2
# Example 
def get_peer_node(username): # function name is get_peer_node
username: creates a username.
The get_peer_node function returns the username back into the function.

# Example
def join_group(node, group): # function name is join_group
node: starts a node but I am not sure what that is.
group: the group the user wants to join.
The join_group function does not return anything, it allows you to join a group. 

# Example
def chat_task(ctx, pipe, n, group): #function name is chat_task
ctx: I am not sure. 
pipe: something to do with the messages moving around.
n: something to do with the node?
group: the group the user wants to join.
The chat_task function does not return anything, I assume it moves around the messages.

# Example
def get_channel(node, group): # function name is get_channel
node: still not sure.
group: same thing, is a group.
The get_channel function returns the chat_task function, (based off the name) might create a new group / chat.
